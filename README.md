# DP-GARCH
 
This is the online appendix to "Dirichlet Process GARCH Mixtures for Volatility & Value-at-Risk Estimation", a semester project at ETH ZÃœrich.

## Abstract:
Bayesian nonparametrics provides a rich set of highly flexible models free of strict distributional assumptions. They circumvent the problem of model selection through data-driven complexity determination and model averaging. This paper explores their application to GARCH models through the Dirichlet process, yielding an infinite mixture GARCH(1,1). In theory, it combines the flexibility of mixture models and Bayesian estima- tion, helping to model the shape of conditional returns and hence improving robustness to misspecification thereof. The hypothesis is tested on simulated data. As reasonable estimation of the model failed, the numerical analysis is limited to a set of its special cases, including a Bayesian, finite mixture, and Bayesian finite mixture GARCH. The merits of both Bayesian estimation and partly those of mixture modeling are supported, but not necessarily in combination.
